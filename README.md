# co-mute

With ever rising fuel prices and increased traffic on our roads, the Co-Mute project was started in an
effort to help alleviate some of these pressures. Car-pooling can cut on travelling and vehicle
maintenance costs. It also enables more effective use of commutersâ€™ time, as time spent driving
could be spent more productively.


The Co-Mute project serves as a market place for commuters to form, find, and join car-pool opportunities.
